Feature: Sort stations by name and show their number of broadcasts
  As a user who is interested into broadcasts of a particular station
  I want the dropdown with stations to be sorted alphabetically
  In order quickly scroll through the list of stations


  Background:
    Given we have these stations in our database:
      | Station       | Medium |
      | Phoenix       | TV     |
      | ZDF           | TV     |
      | WDR Fernsehen | TV     |
    And we have these broadcasts in our database:
      | Title               | Station       | Medium |
      | Phoenix Runde       | Phoenix       | TV     |
      | Fernsehgarten       | ZDF           | TV     |
      | heute-journal       | ZDF           | TV     |
      | Quarks & Co         | WDR Fernsehen | TV     |
      | Mitternachtsspitzen | WDR Fernsehen | TV     |
      | Rockpalast          | WDR Fernsehen | TV     |
    And I am logged in
    And I visit the find broadcasts page

  Scenario: Dropdown menu ordered by name and number of broadcasts visible
    When I filter by medium "TV"
    Then the drop down menu has excactly these items:
      | Text          | Description  |
      | Phoenix       | 1 broadcast  |
      | WDR Fernsehen | 3 broadcasts |
      | ZDF           | 2 broadcasts |
