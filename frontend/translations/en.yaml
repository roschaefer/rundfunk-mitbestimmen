  faq:
    questions:
      survey:
        title: Is this a representative survey?
        content: >
          This is not a representative survey, but an example how to bring more
          democracy into public broadcasting. We want to show that it is
          technically possible, it does not cost much, the contributors have
          their own motivation to publish their wishes and they make wise
          decisions.
      quality:
        title: How can you prevent people from voting nonsense?
        content: >
          Not at all. That is democracy. But apparently<a href="/statistics">
          people do not give money to nonsense</a> after all. On the contrary,
          many give money to cultural programmes and investigative journalism,
          content that comes off badly in TV rankings.
      impact:
        title: Does anybody care?
        content: >
          Yes. Just the data is enough to have an impact. With your decision,
          you tell the creators and the broadcasting councils to keep your
          favourite broadcasts on the air.
      tv-rankings:
        title: Where is the difference to TV ratings?
        content: >
          The results are independent of usage. Apparently,
          <a href="/statistics">the current results</a> do not correlate with TV
          ratings. We hypothesize that it is caused by the different question:
          Which content does one consider valuable? Thus, users reflect their
          decisions and the results are necessarily different.
      representative:
        title: Are the data representative?
        content: >
          Everyone is allowed to participate, there is no pre-selection. So we
          can not garantee that a truly representative cross-section is
          involved. Rundfunk MITBTIMIMMEN also does not claim to be a
          representative survey anyway: The results are not extrapolated. Each
          user decides only about his own fees. In order to achieve an
          improvement, however, this is quite sufficient. Few data are better
          than no data at all.
      consumption:
        title: What if I don't use public broadcasting?
        content: >
          But you pay the broadcasting fees, don't you? Then you should also have
          a right on content and decide how your fees should be used.
      binding:
        title: Are the results binding in any sense?
        content: >
          The results are not binding and they are not an attack on the autonomy
          of public broadcasting. But they are a basis for a debate about
          quality. The fact that the results are public and quantifiable means
          that fee payers receive a strong voice for the very first time.
      minorities:
        title: How about minorities?
        content: >
          "Rundfunk MITBESTIMMEN" is made especially for minorities. For
          example, you can support a few programs, but support these programs
          particularly strong. Small groups would be heard. Such an information
          would be expressed by e.g. the metric <a href="/statistics">"per
          capita"</a>, ie. how important a program is for the target group.
      responsible:
        title: Who are you?
        content: >
          "Rundfunk Mitbestimmen" is mainly developed by volunteers of
          <a href="https://www.agileventures.org/">Agile Ventures</a>, an online
          learner community for open-source software developers.
      finances:
        title: Who is financing this?
        content: >
          We ourselves. With our private money. But we applied for
          <a href="https://prototypefund.de/">funding</a> already.
      business-model:
        title: Do you have a business model?
        content: >
          No. We are not planning to generate a profit with this app.
          Although donations, seed funding and crowdfunding are also regarded as
          business models. We can imagine that for the future.
      data-privacy:
        title: Who can see my email address?
        content: >
          Our data is stored in a server in Frankfurt am Main. Since the
          authentication works through a service called
          <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, the login data is stored in
          two data centers in Frankfurt and Dublin. Only core developers have
          access to the data.
      source-code:
        title: Is it  free software / open-source?
        content: >
          Yes, it is. 100% free (as in freedom), licensed under MIT license. You can find the source code on

        header: Actual amount
        content: >
          The total amount of all broadcasts of a { diffedModel }. It is a good
          sign if this value is higher than the expected amount.
      expected-amount:
        header: Expected amount
        content: >
          The sum of all expected amounts of all broadcasts of a
          { diffedModel }. New broadcasts are added to the database at different
          times. Those broadcasts that have been in the database for a long
          time have an advantage over recently added broadcasts. To get around
          this bias, we calculate the number of "impressions" - how often a
          broadcast was viewed by our users. Based on the impressions, we
          calculate the expected value according to the following formula:
      number-of-broadcasts:
        header: Number of broadcasts
        content: >
          The number of all broadcasts of a { diffedModel } in the database.
          Obviously, the actual amount and especially the expected amount
          correlates with this value. If many new broadcasts of a TV or radio
          station have been added to the database, this value is higher compared
          to the expected amount.
