      With a symbolic amount you can evaluate the quality of public
      broadcasts according to your own criteria. Support your favourite
      broadcasts and let them know, of course anonymously.

      The results are not binding in a legal sense, but public and quantifiable.
      In this way people who pay the fees have got a strong voice which is enough
      to have an impact. With your decision we can attract attention of the
      broadcasting councils and increase the public debate on program diversity.

    questions:
      survey:
        title: Is this a survey?
        content: >
          This is not a survey but a demonstration how we could democratise
          public broadcasting in Germany. We want to show that it is technically
          possible, it is cheap, contributors want to participate and they can
          make good decisions.
      tv-rankings:
        title: Why are TV rankings not enough?
        content: >
          Many contributors do not consume public broadcasting but
          pay as much as everybody else and have a right on content. Besides
          that, public broadcasting in Germany has a political and educational
          mandate and is required to be independent of TV rankings.
      quality:
        title: How can you prevent people from voting nonsense?
        content: >
          Not at all. That is democracy. But apparently<a href="/statistics">
          people do not give money to nonsense</a> after all. On the contrary,
          many give money to cultural programmes and investigative journalism,
          content that comes off badly in TV rankings.
      binding:
        title: Are the results binding in any sense?
        content: >
          The results are not binding in a legal sense, instead they simply
          represent the opinion of the people who pay the fees. But the fact
          that the results are public and quantifiable gives people a strong
          voice, for the very first time.
      minorities:
        title: How about minorities?
        content: >
          "Rundfunk MITBESTIMMEN" is designed especially for minorities. The
          metric "per capita" can be seen on the
          <a href="/statistics">results page</a>. This is the amount that
          supporters spend on average for the respective program.  Thus, small
          groups are given a voice to particularly support their broadcast. The
          metric means roughly: "How important is the broadcast for the specific
          target group?"
      responsible:
        title: Who are you?
        content: >
          "Rundfunk Mitbestimmen" is mainly developed by
          <a href="https://github.com/roschaefer">Robert Schäfer</a>, a student
          at the <a href="https://hpi.de/">HPI</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/somamo">Katharina Ehrhardt</a>, a
          professional user experience designer from Potsdam. We are working
          together with foundations that are committed to open data and members
          of broadcasting councils. Last but not least, all our users who take
          part and publish their data are supporting us.
      representative:
        title: Is the data representative?
        content: >
          No. And it does not need to be. Only the money of users who published
          their preferences may be distributed to the respective broadcasts. For
          everybody else, everything remains as it is. At the moment, just the
          broadcasting boards distribute all the monies autonomously.
      consumption:
        title: What if someone does not consume public broadcasting?
        content: >
          Every contributor has a right on content, indifferent of usage.
          By the way, many users know exactly if they want to pay for a
          broadcast even if they do not use public broadcasting at all.
      impact:
        title: Does anybody care?
        content: >
          Yes. Just the data is enough to have an impact. With your decision,
          you tell the creators and the broadcasting councils to keep your
          favourite broadcasts on the air.
      finances:
        title: Who is financing this?
        content: >
          We ourselves. With our private money. But we applied for
          <a href="https://prototypefund.de/">funding</a> already.
      business-model:
        title: Do you have a business model?
        content: >
          No. We are not planning to generate a profit with this app, ever.
      data-privacy:
        title: Who can see my email address?
        content: >
          Our data is stored in a server in Frankfurt am Main. Since the
          authentication works through a service called
          <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, the login data is stored in
          two data centers in Frankfurt and Dublin. Only core developers have
          access to the data. Of course, passwords are not stored in clear text,
          so not even core developers are able to read them.
      source-code:
        title: Is it  free software / open-source?
        content: >
          Yes, it is. 100% free (as in freedom), licensed under MIT license. You can find the source code on
          <a href="https://github.com/roschaefer/rundfunk-mitbestimmen">
